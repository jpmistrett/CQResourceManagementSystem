# CQResourceManagementSystem
C++ files for the resource management system in Captain Quantum

This code is used in tandem with the UE4 UMG system to execute logic not included in strict C++ code, like creating and adding the UUserWidget to the viewport, etc. It speaks with other parts of the project that make actual gameplay changes. The game is singleplayer so most of the things are simply stored in the player controller/character.
